# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/f1718176-4080-4bf5-9910-b3d5b66f3fb7

## Backend API

This repository now includes a Python FastAPI backend scaffold located in the `backend/` directory. The backend provides AI-powered automation using AgentScope and local Ollama LLMs, and persists data to Supabase.

See `backend/README.md` for setup, configuration, and usage instructions.

## Revenue Analytics

The revenue analytics system provides comprehensive insights into subscription-based revenue, including Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), subscription trends, customer lifetime value (LTV), and revenue breakdowns by pricing package.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/analytics/revenue/summary` - Retrieves key revenue metrics like MRR, ARR, total revenue, active subscriptions, cancelled subscriptions, and churn rate for a specified time range.
- `GET /api/analytics/revenue/by-package` - Returns revenue breakdown by pricing package, including subscription counts and average revenue per subscription.
- `GET /api/analytics/revenue/subscription-trends` - Provides time-series data on new subscriptions, cancellations, net changes, and cumulative active subscriptions, with daily or weekly aggregation.
- `GET /api/analytics/revenue/customer-ltv` - Lists customer lifetime value metrics, such as total spent, subscription count, and estimated LTV, with pagination support.
- `GET /api/analytics/revenue/subscriptions/list` - Lists all subscriptions with filtering options (e.g., by status or package) and pagination.

### Generating Test Data

To create sample subscription data for testing and development:

1. Run the script: `python backend/generate_test_subscription_data.py`
2. This generates 20-30 subscriptions across Starter, Professional, and Enterprise pricing tiers, with varied statuses (70% active, 20% cancelled, 10% expired), random start dates over the past year, and calculated end dates and pricing.

### Running Tests

To verify the revenue analytics functionality:

1. Set up environment variables in `.env`: `USER_JWT_TOKEN` and `ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN` for authentication.
2. Run the test suite: `python backend/test_analytics_api.py`
3. This executes all analytics tests, including revenue-specific ones for data consistency, edge cases, and endpoint validation.

### Frontend Integration

Revenue metrics are visualized in the Dashboard component. Use the following custom hooks for data fetching:

- `useAnalytics`: Fetches summary revenue metrics.
- `useSubscriptionTrends`: Retrieves subscription trend data with time range and aggregation options.
- `useRevenueByPackage`: Gets revenue breakdown by package.
- `useCustomerLTV`: Fetches customer LTV data with pagination.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { useAnalytics, useSubscriptionTrends } from '@/hooks/useAnalyticsTrends';

const { data: summary } = useAnalytics({ timeRange: { start_date: '2024-01-01', end_date: '2024-12-31' } });
const { data: trends } = useSubscriptionTrends({ timeRange: { start_date: '2024-01-01', end_date: '2024-12-31' }, aggregation: 'daily' });
```

### Database Schema

Revenue analytics rely on the following tables and migrations:

- **Migrations**: `supabase/migrations/20250126000004_add_pricing.sql` (defines `pricing_packages` and `user_subscriptions` tables) and `20250126000006_add_revenue_analytics.sql` (adds RPC functions for analytics).
- **Relationships**:
  - `user_subscriptions` links users to subscriptions, referencing `pricing_packages` for package details and `pricing_campaigns` for discounts.
  - RPC functions query these tables to compute metrics like MRR (sum of active subscription prices) and trends (grouped by creation/cancellation dates).

For more details, refer to the migration files and backend models.

## Real-Time Analytics Updates

The dashboard supports real-time analytics updates via WebSocket connections, allowing you to see metrics update instantly as data changes.

### Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI WebSocket endpoint at `/api/ws/analytics` with JWT authentication
- **Event Broadcasting**: Redis pub/sub for scalable event distribution across multiple backend instances
- **Frontend**: Custom React hook (`useWebSocket`) that integrates with React Query for automatic cache invalidation

### Setup Requirements
- Redis must be running and configured via `REDIS_URL` environment variable
- If Redis is unavailable, the system gracefully degrades to polling-based updates

### Events Triggered
- Lead creation/updates → refreshes lead metrics and trends
- Conversation messages → refreshes conversation metrics and trends
- Subscription changes → refreshes revenue metrics and subscription trends
- Agent actions → refreshes agent performance metrics

### Testing
- Start Redis: `redis-server` (or use Docker: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis`)
- Start backend: `cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- Start frontend: `npm run dev`
- Open dashboard and observe the "Live" indicator in the top-right corner
- Create a test lead via API or UI and watch metrics update in real-time

### Troubleshooting
- If WebSocket shows "Offline", check that Redis is running and `REDIS_URL` is configured
- Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
- Verify JWT token is valid (WebSocket requires authentication)
- Check backend logs for Redis connection issues

## Notification System

**Overview:**
- Explain that the platform includes a comprehensive notification system for real-time alerts about leads, agent actions, workflows, and system events
- Notifications are delivered via both REST API and WebSocket for real-time updates
- Users see notifications in a dropdown menu in the dashboard header, and critical alerts appear as toast notifications

**Notification Types:**
- **Lead notifications**: Created when leads are submitted or analyzed
- **Agent notifications**: Created when agents complete tasks or encounter errors
- **Workflow notifications**: Created when workflows complete or fail
- **Conversation notifications**: Created for important conversation milestones
- **System notifications**: Created for system-wide alerts (admin only)

**Severity Levels:**
- **Info**: General informational notifications (blue)
- **Success**: Successful operations (green)
- **Warning**: Important warnings that need attention (yellow)
- **Error**: Critical errors that require immediate action (red)

**Backend API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/notifications` - List notifications with filtering and pagination
- `GET /api/notifications/{id}` - Get a specific notification
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-read` - Mark notifications as read
- `POST /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all notifications as read
- `DELETE /api/notifications/{id}` - Delete a notification
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread notification count
- `WS /api/ws/notifications` - WebSocket endpoint for real-time notifications

**Database Schema:**
- `notifications` table stores all notifications with recipient, type, severity, title, message, action URL, metadata, and read status
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own notifications
- Automatic cleanup of expired notifications

**Frontend Integration:**
- `useNotifications` hook provides access to notifications with real-time updates
- Notification bell icon in dashboard header shows unread count
- Clicking the bell opens a dropdown with recent notifications
- Critical notifications (errors/warnings) appear as Sonner toast notifications
- Notifications can link to related resources (e.g., leads, workflows)

**Creating Notifications (for developers):**
```python
from app.utils.notification_service import create_notification

await create_notification(
    recipient_id=user_id,
    notification_type="lead",
    severity="success",
    title="New Lead Created",
    message="Lead has been successfully created",
    action_url="/dashboard/leads/123",
    metadata={"lead_id": "123"}
)
```

**Real-Time Delivery:**
- Notifications are published to Redis channel `notifications:user:{user_id}`
- WebSocket connection automatically receives new notifications
- Frontend React Query cache is invalidated, triggering UI updates
- Toast notifications appear immediately for critical events

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive test suites for both frontend and backend components, with a focus on automated testing to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Frontend Tests
- **Command to run tests**: `npm test` or `npm run test:watch`
- **Command for coverage**: `npm run test:coverage`
- **Location of test files**: `src/**/__tests__/` and `src/**/*.test.tsx`
- **Note about test utilities**: Test utilities are available in `src/test/utils/` (e.g., `renderWithProviders` for component testing), and mocks are located in `src/test/mocks/` (e.g., for WebSocket and authentication).

### Backend Tests
- **Command to run tests**: `cd backend && pytest`
- **Command for coverage**: `cd backend && pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html`
- **Location of test files**: `backend/tests/`
- **Note about fixtures**: Shared fixtures and utilities are defined in `backend/tests/conftest.py` for mocking dependencies like Supabase and Redis.

### Notification System Tests
The notification system has extensive test coverage across frontend and backend layers to validate real-time delivery, API endpoints, and WebSocket functionality.
- **Frontend**: Hook tests (`useNotifications.test.tsx` for WebSocket lifecycle and mutations), Dashboard tests (`Dashboard.notifications.test.tsx` for toast display and filtering).
- **Backend**: API tests (`test_notifications_api.py` for REST endpoints), WebSocket tests (`test_notifications_websocket.py` for real-time delivery), Service tests (`test_notification_service.py` for utility functions).
- **Note about mocked dependencies**: Tests mock WebSocket connections, Supabase database queries, and Redis pub/sub to ensure isolation and reliability.

### Running Specific Tests
- **Frontend**: `npm test -- useNotifications` to run a specific test file (e.g., hook tests).
- **Backend**: `pytest tests/test_notifications_api.py` to run a specific test file, or `pytest -k "test_mark_read"` to run tests matching a pattern (e.g., mark-read functionality).

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Frontend**: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- **Backend**: 70% (to be configured)

For manual testing of notifications (e.g., during development):
- Create test notifications via API or directly in the database.
- Monitor WebSocket connections in browser DevTools.
- Check Redis pub/sub messages: `redis-cli SUBSCRIBE notifications:user:*`
