# Frontend Environment Variables Example

# Note: All Vite environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be exposed to the client-side application.

## API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
# Backend API base URL

## Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
# Supabase project URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
# Supabase anonymous key for client-side usage

## Sentry Error Monitoring (Optional)
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
# Get this from Sentry.io project settings for the frontend project
VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
# Environment name: development | staging | production
VITE_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1
# Performance monitoring sample rate, 0.0 to 1.0
VITE_SENTRY_RELEASE=pixelcraft-frontend@1.0.0
# Release version, typically from git commit or package.json version

# Instructions for Sentry Setup:
# 1. Create separate Sentry projects for frontend and backend in your Sentry dashboard.
# 2. For the frontend project, copy the DSN from the project settings and replace the placeholder in VITE_SENTRY_DSN.
# 3. Ensure the backend has its own Sentry project with a different DSN (configured in the backend .env file).
# 4. Set appropriate environment names (development, staging, production) for each deployment.
# 5. Update the release version to match your application's versioning scheme.
